a/udev-182-x86_64-6.txz:  Rebuilt.
  The upgrade to the 3.7.1 kernel broke the generation of persistent optical
  device rules, and existing rules in 70-persistent-cd.rules no longer worked.
  This update fixes the issue by basing the rules on ID_SERIAL rather than
  ID_PATH (which is not supported by the new kernel's libata transport class).
  After upgrading the package, remove /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-cd.rules
  and reboot the machine.  This will create a working rules file and restore
  the expected symbolic links to optical devices in /dev.
x/xf86-input-vmmouse-12.9.0-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Replaced the HAL config files with udev rules.  Thanks to Tomas M.
xap/gucharmap-3.4.1-x86_64-2.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Install the doinst.sh header properly, and use chroot to run
  update-desktop-database and glib-compile-schemas to insure the package is
  installed correctly during an initial installation.
  Thanks to David Gabriel Rodriguez Castillo and Matteo Bernardini.

  crash or run programs upon opening a specially crafted file.

d/cmake-2.8.10.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
d/llvm-3.2-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  I'm not sure how this behaves with the X.Org/Mesa stuff that uses llvm, but
  we can cross that bridge when we get to it.  We were due for an update here
  anyway, and can't very well just let LLVM/Clang sit broken in -current.
l/seamonkey-solibs-2.15-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
xap/mozilla-firefox-18.0-x86_64-1.txz:  Upgraded.
  This release contains security fixes and improvements.
  For more information, see:

  (* Security fix *)
  In addition, the build script has been moved from using ./configure back
  to .mozconfig in order to build with profile-guided optimization by default.
  The script itself parses ./configure like syntax for ease of hacking.
  Better icons in more resolutions are installed as well.
  Thanks much to Matteo Bernardini for the improvements!

Every time the world is about to end, all I want to do is compile kernels.
So, here you go...  the final kernel updates. *
Still testing the new glibc, which removes the gets() function and may or may
not be a safe upgrade yet.  It might be safer after the next gcc comes out.

a/mkinitrd-1.4.7-x86_64-7.txz:  Rebuilt.
  Added support for the parameter names that control the delay before
  attempting to mount the root filesystem, and the root file system type:
  'rootdelay' 'rootfstype' respectively.  These are the official/documented
  parameters in the kernel documentation.  The original parameters ('rootfs'
  and 'waitforroot') may still be used.
  Thanks to Thorsten Mühlfelder and Richard Lapointe for the suggestion.
  For ARM devices: unless specified when the initrd is built, or at boot
  time as a kernel parameter, wait a minimum of four seconds for the root
  device to become ready.
  Thanks to Jerome Pinot for the suggestion and the patch.

  Patched a heap-based buffer underflow in the xmlParseAttValueComplex

  remote attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute
  arbitrary code via crafted entities in an XML document.

Slackware 14.0 x86_64 stable is released!

We're perfectionists here at Slackware, so this release has been a long
time a-brewing.  But we think you'll agree that it was worth the wait.
Slackware 14.0 combines modern components, ease of use, and flexible
configuration... our "KISS" philosophy demands it.

The ISOs are off to be replicated, a 6 CD-ROM 32-bit set and a dual-sided
32-bit/64-bit x86/x86_64 DVD.  Please consider supporting the Slackware
project by picking up a copy from store.slackware.com.  We're taking
pre-orders now, and offer a discount if you sign up for a subscription.

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen.  The Slackware team, the
upstream developers, and (of course) the awesome Slackware user community.

Have fun!  :-)
